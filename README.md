# Bioinformatics Pipelines Repository

Welcome to our comprehensive collection of bioinformatics workflows, specifically designed for a diverse range of high-throughput sequencing data. This project aims to be a foundational educational resource for courses exploring various data types and analytical methodologies.

## Data Types and Methodologies Covered:

- **RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq):** Explore gene expression analysis and more with RNA-seq data.
- **Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATAC-seq):** Dive into chromatin accessibility landscapes.
- **Single-cell Sequencing:** Unravel cellular heterogeneity and lineage tracing.
- **Multiome Analysis:** Combine genomics and transcriptomics data for a holistic view.
- **DNA Methylation Analysis:** Investigate epigenetic modifications influencing gene expression.

## Repository Structure:

Each directory within this repository focuses on a specific sequencing data type. You'll find everything needed to get started, including:

- **Scripts:** Automate your analysis with our custom scripts.
- **Workflows:** Follow step-by-step guides to process your data.
- **Example Data:** Test the pipelines with real-world data samples.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine or server environment.
2. **Navigate to the data type** of interest to find relevant resources.
3. **Follow the workflow documentation** within each directory for detailed data processing instructions.

This repository is designed to support both beginners and advanced researchers in the field of bioinformatics. Whether you're looking to understand basic concepts or dive into complex analyses, you'll find the tools and information needed to advance your research.
